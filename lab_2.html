            <h3><strong>Art To Me</strong></h3>
                    <p>I have been creating art ever since I can remember. I was one of those kids that when asked what <br>
                        I wanted to be when I grew up I would answer with something along the lines of painter or inventor.<br>
                        When I was young I lived in Arkansas. I remember having this hutch in the dining room full of art<br>
                        supplise and when we moved to Mass i had my own table to make art<br>
                        I have always loved creating things and expresing my thoughts and feelings through art.<br>

            <h3>Music And Art</h3>
                <p>To me music and art go hand and hand. As Paul Cézanne said "A work of art which did not begin in emotion is not art." <br>
                    art and music are based on emotion. Music makes us feel deeper emotion and when creating art while listening to music <br>
                    you can explore deeper or more intense emotion.</p>
